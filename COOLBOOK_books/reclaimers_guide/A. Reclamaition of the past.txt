%TITLE: A. Reclamation and you!

History

Greetings Reclaimer!  We are happy to have you here in our collective.  This chapter is a short history of the Reclaimers, and while
you should have learned in during indoctrination we understand that sometimes people are rushed in without much in the way of full
on teaching!  Remember that this is a shorthand document and not by any means a full history.

Purpose

The Reclaimers were formed in the ruins of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, largely by scientists and historians shortly after the fall
of the old world. We gather together behind a unified concept of researching the past to make tomorrow better. That is the 
absolute most simple way to put it.  While each Reclaimer has a different way of doing so we all must work together to make tomorrow's 
sunrise a little bit better!

A large part of the Reclaimers is combining the various Science jobs that are in normal SS13 with Xenoarch (Well, lets be real just
archeology, we're not really in space!) to have a unified factional space.  These are jobs for the tech minded, be you a mech fanatic, 
nanite chugger, or rock digging madman. Your main purpose in rounds is making whatever techno-bullshit you can dream up and trying to 
make life easier for most folks!
