%TITLE:B. Archeologist

The role of Archeologist in the Reclaimers is one of the most pure to our cause, digging through the remains of yesterday to find 
whatever you can.  It really doesn't get any more basic than that!

Do

Go out and dig like crazy!  You are the source of the most basic mining resources if the Reclaimers don't have anyone to hire for mining.

Use your strange rocks to help fuel research, not all of them need to be cracked open for whatever crazy thing might be inside, but this is 
more useful early in the round than later.  Unless you're really pressed for points!

Bring a guard with you, it's not usually super dangerous out there, but they might appreciate seeing more than the backside of a door!

Don'ts

Needlessly horde ores and strange rocks, resources are meant to be used, not gather dust.  If we wanted them doing that you could have left them in the ground!

Being a quiet dungeon delving archeologist is a fast way to get in trouble and not have help, be vocal and let people know you're around!

Tips for newbies

There are DEFINITELY better ways to dig than the ones you start with, get with a researcher and figure that out!
