The Village of Ashdown

We're real glad y'all decided to take the time to open this here book, and in this chapter here we'll be going over exactly what our little town is about.

Situated just on the north side of the Red River you, citizen or nomad, belong to the greater once-state of Arkansas!  Our home has been in this location
for just about as long as anyone can remember, reaching back to when the world went mad!  We offer such great amenities as...

- Most of a clinic

- Parts of a workshop

- Two bars!
- Mining encampments

- Mirelurks living under your very feet, an endless source of entertainment!

- A mostly safe park just outside!*

We take a lotta pride around here in our freedom of expression and allowance to what sorta things we'd expect outta folks. Act right, you know what that means partner.**

*The ATA has no responsibility if y'all go out an get yerselves killed in the park, we told ya' mostly, that meant mostly!

**The information on 'Actin' right' can be found in yer Guidebook to Southern Living, page 443.  Yes, we know the books only 202 pages long, but the damn contents say it should be there.  So that's that.

Our History

Not much is remembered of what our village was like before the skies turned green and people started dying, mostly just hearsay that no one can agree on.  We are pretty
sure that the village was larger, maybe even a whole TOWN in the great green state of Arkansas!  There was a factory of some sort, we're not sure if it was a screen door
factory, a paper mill, or a chicken factory but it's pretty clear that it was real, though the ruins have long been repurposed to build our home.

About 17 generations ago, as far as anyone can tell*, our people found this here hill that we live on and turned it into our own little castle in the sky.  Building a
gigantic trading and bar complex on the lower level and then moving our people into the upper plateau.  While we've historically kept mostly to our selves, due to being situated
in this fantastically favorable spot within spittin distance o' the old Red River** of late we*** decided to allow a roving gang of mostly friendly and lost wasters in.

Since then our fortunes have turned up pretty good!**** The Hells Nomads and the people o' Ashdown seem poised for a great future together!  

*This fact is hotly debated in Ashdown intelectual circles.

**It's a real hocking stretch if ya ain't got good spitting muscles.

***The elders, our non-democratic shadow government

****Debatable.

Our new friends, the Hells Nomads

About so many seasons ago* a group of INTREPID and BRAVE adventurers wandered into the swamps from a direction unknown.  Taking refuge in a police station dang near
the heart of the ruins of Texarkana the Hells Nomads FOUGHT like BRAVE MADMEN to hold onto what little space they had eeked out.  The madness portal storms of the swamps
forcing the otherwise OBVIOUSLY nomadic group to grow roots.  Being relatively close to the township of Nash to the south they ended up in occasional disuputes over
supplies, women, booze, and the other things you'd expect a Nashy to want to shoot ya' over.**

As their supplies dwindled and their folk began to starve the nomads attempted to escape from the area, mounting their honses and motorcycles they rode forth to the north.
In desperate belief that perhaps finding a crossin to the Red River would gift them with peace of the non-eternal sort.***

Well, the reality o the matter was they ran smack dab into our park, bleeding tired and barely able to move a foot further we welcomed the lot of em' in with open arms.****
Since then they've taken on the role of the protectors of the village, with their overbiker reporting directly to the elders, at least when they can be bothered.

They don't quite boss us around, and we don't quite view them as poor beaten animals in need o some love and direction, but it ain't far from that.  Remember they're
yer new neighbors and do show them that southern hospitality we've read so much about in half burned books in the old school, would ya' kindly?

If ya' happen to be a Hells Nomad reading this, we salute you brave soul!  Please help us keep the peace and respect your overbiker!  Lest the shadowcouncil kill ya and feed ya' to the mirelurks!

*Editors note: What time system should we use?  The seasons stopped cycling long ago, how many months has it even been?  What is today?

**More on this in the next chapter!

***This means not dyin y'all, come on.

****And soft beds, the soft beds really helped.

The Township of Nash

A bit to the south and up-river from our fine village is the 'Township'* of "New Boston".  The town can be a bit of a pain to get ta'**, but if you follow the main highway south of town east, 
then south, then south till ya' come to the old park in Texarkana (you've gone too far if you go in, there be nightstalkers in yonder) and head westwards.  You'll run basically smack dab into
that 'place'

The town is run by a pack of lunatic councilmen*** picked from the community.  Be wary of the Nasher, prickly folk.  Mind yer' manners about em and you should be aight.  Remember that they
got things like a 'jail' and only one bar actually in town (actually broke, how can anyone be this poor?)

You can find proper trade with them in the form of salvage, weaponry and other goods though as they seem to have an underground connection to the Texas Sub-Railroad System**** allowing them to 
send off for goods, or sell yours on a larger market.

Anyways, feel free to visit em' if you want to risk the trip. Be sure to say hello to the kind hearted tribe that takes residence in the northern half part of the town.  At least they're decent folk***** most 
of the time.


*A strong word for guys stacking 'boxes' they call 'buildings' on top of each other.
**Not worth it probably
***In stark counterpoint to our shadowcouncils generous and kind rule
****We're not sure, it might be a pack of mules pulling a shit wagon in a poop tube, who fucking knows.  It works though.
*****We're not entirely sure they're even people, might be enlightened Geckos.  If you have more information please come to the next shadow council meeting at [REDACTED] on the [REDACTED] of [REDACTED].

The Ruins of the city of Redlick

To the west of us, saddling its thighs across the width of the Red River is the old world town of Redlick.  Its ruins help to supply us with much needed material, tools, and even the occasional bit of technology.

The constant warp storms blow all sorts of crap in, so its always worth checking out.  Not much is actually known about the place other than its falling apart, the River Waters about as safe to drink as Hellpig piss,
and that you may want to be wary of places north of the river.  Tread with care Citizen/Nomad, it's not a place for the foolish and unprepared.*

*of which you are certainly NEITHER, dear reader.
